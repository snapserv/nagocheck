## Introduction

nagocheck is a collection of Nagios plugins, which can be used by both Nagios
as well as Icinga for monitoring your infrastructure. All the plugins are
available through a single binary called `nagocheck`, which offers an intuitive
command line interface.

The plugins are based on nagopher, which is a Go library for easily creating
such plugins. Feel free to open an issue if you are missing a specific check or
encountering any issues.
